# Welcome to Dagster ODP

Dagster ODP (Open Data Platform) is a Python library built on top of the Dagster orchestrator, designed to simplify the creation and management of data pipelines. With ODP, data teams can build robust pipelines using JSON/YAML configuration instead of writing extensive code. 

While Dagster provides powerful orchestration capabilities, ODP takes it a step further by offering a more accessible way to define pipelines. This approach reduces the learning curve, promotes standardization, and enables faster development of data workflows.

## Who is this for?

Dagster ODP is ideal for data teams looking to streamline their pipeline development process, including:

- Data Engineers seeking to standardize pipeline creation and reduce boilerplate code
- Data Analysts and Scientists who want to create pipelines without extensive coding
- Organizations aiming to improve collaboration between technical and non-technical team members
- Teams using or planning to use tools like DLT, DBT, or Soda who want simplified integration
